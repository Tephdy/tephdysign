                <p class="text-white font-weight-light"><i>State policy declaration</i></p>
                <p class="text-white" style="text-align: left;">The State recognizes that an effective intellectual and industrial property system is vital to the development of domestic and creative activity, facilitates transfer of technology, attracts foreign investments, and ensures market access
                    for our products. It shall protect and secure the exclusive rights of scientists, inventors, artists and other gifted citizens to their intellectual property and creations, particularly when beneficial to the people, for such periods
                    as provided in this Act.
                </p>
                <p class="text-white" style="text-align: left;">
                    The use of intellectual property bears a social function. To this end, the State shall promote the diffusion of knowledge and information for the promotion of national development and progress and the common good.
                </p>
                <p class="text-white" style="text-align: left;">
                    It is also the policy of the State to streamline administrative procedures of registering patents, trademarks and copyright, to liberalize the registration on the transfer of technology, and to enhance the enforcement of intellectual property rights in
                    the Philippines.
                </p>
                <p class="text-white font-weight-light"><i>Effect on international conventions and on principle of reciprocity:</i></p>
                <p class="text-white" style="text-align: left;">Any person who is a national or who is domiciled or has a real and effective industrial establishment in a country which is a party to any convention, treaty or agreement relating to intellectual property rights or the repression of unfair
                    competition, to which the Philippines is also a party, or extends reciprocal rights to nationals of the Philippines by law, shall be entitled to benefits to the extent necessary to give effect to any provision of such convention, treaty
                    or reciprocal law, in addition to the rights to which any owner of an intellectual property right is otherwise entitled by this Act.
