                <p class="text-white" style="text-align:left;">TephdySign is the second newest website built by aspiring website and graphic designer <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://web.facebook.com/Osseepphh" class="text-white text-decoration-none">Joseph Amandy</a></span>. The
                    creator spent almost six months building this minimalist website design that will showcase his creativity in terms of graphics art. TephdySign will be a live witness of his growth and improvement as a graphic artist and website designer
                    as well. This might be a static website for now but as times goes by and he gains more website designing skills, this surely will transform from static to dynamic website with more interaction to its user (visitor). The contents will
                    be also become more eye-catching soon.</p>

                <p class="text-white style=" style=" text-align: left; ">TephdySign came from mixing the two words Tephdy and Design. Tephdy is his mispronunciation of his name Joseph Amandy. Design came from literally design itself, because Joseph Amandy is really has a passion in designing and on how to improve
                    it. </p>

                <p class="text-white" style="text-align: left; "> All that passion in website and graphic designing are the reason of TephdySign existence.</p>
